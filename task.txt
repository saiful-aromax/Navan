The attached dataset has the following fields:

department: Associated department with the instance 
team_no: Associated team number with the instance 
no_of_workers: Number of workers in each team 
no_of_style_change: Number of changes in the style of a particular product 
targeted_productivity: Targeted productivity set by the Authority for each team for each day. 
smv: Standard Minute Value, it is the allocated time for a task 
wip: Work in progress. Includes the number of unfinished items for products 
over_time: Represents the amount of overtime by each team in minutes 
incentive: Represents the amount of financial incentive (in BDT) that enables or motivates a particular course of action. 
idle_time: The amount of time when the production was interrupted due to several reasons 
idle_men: The number of workers who were idle due to production interruption 
actual_productivity: The actual % of productivity that was delivered by the workers. It ranges from 0-1. 
 
Do the following tasks:

Inferential Statistics  
The company believes implemented new machines and they believe this would reduce the average overtime (in minutes) that the workers will do, which will lead to a cost reduction in the end. They tried it in a group of 200 workers, which shows an average overtime of 6300 minutes. Can we say that the company is right? Formulate an appropriate hypothesis and justify your answer.
Formulate an appropriate analysis to determine the real average productivity of these workers each day of the week. Is there any difference between the days? Along with your results, provide a possible explanation on the outcome.
 
Regression Analysis
Use some variables of the dataset to perform regression analysis. You should identify the key variables that influence employeeâ€™s productivity.
